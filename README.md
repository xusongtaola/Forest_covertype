# Forest_covertype
A neural network is used a classification model that predicst the cover type of a forest solely based on cartographic varaibles. The neural network is trained using ADAM which is a stochastic gradient-based method. The  algorithm for the Neural networ was directly implemented and contained in the package ML_tools (which is contained in the repository ML_CV_tools).
